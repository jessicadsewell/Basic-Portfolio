      <img src="assets/images/IMG_9788.JPG" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p> My name is Jessica Sewell and I am Full Stack Web Development student with a background in Management and Nutrition.</p>

      <p> I've worn a lot of hats that have provided me a variety of problems to solve, people to work with and solutions to create. </p>

      <p> Through web development, I've found a love for creating and fine-tuning to allow a product or business to thrive. The reward of building and improving as a team continues to motivate and excite me. 
      
      <p> I'm looking to work with and for likeminded people who also want to provide a great user experience all while having fun and remaining personable.</p>
